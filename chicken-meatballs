# Chicken Cilantro Meatballs with Peanut Sauce

From https://www.rachaelraymag.com/recipe/chicken-meatballs-with-sweet-peanut-sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground chicken
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- 1/4 cup dried breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup grated onion
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 3 tablespoons sesame oil
- Chopped peanuts, for garnish

## Directions

Mix chicken, cilantro, breadcrumbs, onion, garlic, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl (big enough to use your hands to combine the ingredients).
Roll into 1-tablespoon balls. I use a cookie scoop or melon baller for consistency.
In medium skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat.
Add meatballs and cook through, 6 to 8 minutes.

- Sauce -
Meanwhile, mix remaining ingredients (except peanuts) and warm in microwave.
Toss meatballs with half of sauce and sprinkle with peanuts. (Instead, we use chunky peanut butter for those who want the consistency of crunchy nuts and smooth for those who don't.)
Serve on toothpicks with remaining sauce for dipping.

## Comments

This is a go-to, delicious and easy dinner that my family loves. I find you can sub out the sesame oil with more vegetable oil 1:1 if you don't have any. Happy birthday!!
